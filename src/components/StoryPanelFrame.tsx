 * The dialogue panel's frame, drawn rather than stretched from the sprite.
 *
 * The game's own art is 511x158, so a panel wider than that upscales it: 1.15x at a 1280 stage and 2.3x at 2560, which softened the
 * hairline border and the mark until neither read cleanly. Drawing the same shapes keeps them sharp at any size. The outline uses a
 * non-scaling stroke, so it stays one pixel however far the panel is stretched, and the mark is text rather than pixels.
 *
 * The panel's fill and its dot grid stay in CSS on the box behind this, since a repeating gradient tiles more cheaply than a path.
 *
 * One figure departs from the sprite on purpose: the game lets the mark overhang the white block by nine pixels, and here it ends
 * flush with it.
 *
 * @param props The component's props.
 * @returns The frame, drawn over the panel and ignoring pointer events.
