/**
 * Mount, drive and tear down a Live2D stage on a canvas. Shared by the fairy card, the fairy viewer and the HOC
 * card, the three places a model gets its own canvas.
 *
 * Creates the stage whenever `modelUrl` is defined and destroys it whenever `modelUrl` changes, becomes undefined,
 * or the caller unmounts. A caller opts out of having any model mounted by passing undefined - the fairy card does
 * this while `Art` is selected, and the HOC card while a Spine rig is selected instead of `Live2D`. Only one stage
 * exists process-wide at a time (`createLive2dStage` destroys whatever stage came before it), and this hook's own
 * effect cleanup makes sure this caller's stage is torn down on every exit, so switching between stages or callers
 * never leaks a WebGL context. The canvas is measured once per model rather than tracked with a resize observer,
 * matching the fairy viewer and HOC card this replaces: `sizeRef` measures a separate box when the canvas's own
 * box cannot be trusted, such as the viewer's zoom container, which keeps a stable size while the canvas itself
 * carries a zoom transform.
 *
 * The runtime loader is imported dynamically, gated on `modelUrl` being defined, so a page that renders this hook
 * for a model-less fairy or HOC never parses `live2d.ts` at all.
 *
 * The caller must give its canvas element `key={modelUrl}`. Swapping models on a canvas that stays mounted - the
 * fairy card's form toggle, or the viewer's star rank picker, while Live2D stays selected - tears down one WebGL
 * context and creates another on the same canvas node, which reliably fails with a `checkMaxIfStatementsInShader`
 * error from the vendored runtime. Keying the canvas by `modelUrl` makes React mount a fresh node for each model
 * instead, sidestepping the failure. The HOC card's canvas unmounts on every exit from Live2D regardless, but
 * carries the same key for consistency, in case a future caller reuses it across a model change without unmounting.
 *
 * @param canvasRef The canvas to render into.
 * @param modelUrl URL of the model's `model3.json`, or undefined to keep the stage empty.
 * @param tabs The model's motion tabs, for `advance` and for picking the opening motion once the stage is ready.
 * @param sizeRef Element to measure for the canvas's pixel size, when it differs from the canvas itself.
 * @returns The stage's status, current motion, and the controls to drive it.
