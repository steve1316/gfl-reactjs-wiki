"""Join `stc/live2d.json` into the set of T-Doll skin Live2D models worth building.

The table names one row per playable combination. `fit_gun` is the doll id, offset by `MOD_ID_OFFSET` when the row is for a doll's Mod form,
and `skin` is the skin id or 0 for the form's own base art. A row's `code` names its bundle, `live2dnew_gun_<code lowercased>`.

The key is `(doll_id, form, skin_key)` and all three parts are load bearing. Dropping `form` collides in 41 cases, and one of those is a real
difference rather than a duplicate: `AR15_4508` and `AR15Mod` both describe skin 4508, but resolve to `live2dnew_gun_ar15_4508` and
`live2dnew_gun_ar15mod`, which are different models. A Mod row whose own `<Code>Mod_<skinId>` bundle does not exist instead points at the base
doll's `<code>_<skinId>` bundle, because that Mod really does wear the base model. Two keys then name one bundle, which is published once.

Rows that are not dolls carry `fit_gun` of 0 or -1: the `cg_*` scenes, `NPC_Kalina` and `NPC_William_live2d`. The filter is `fit_gun > 0`, not
`fit_gun != -1`, because the cg rows use 0.
